# SQL joins relations

**Author**: Jimmy, Scott 
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This allows for insert, update, and deleting articles. We used two smaller tables instead of 1 large table to minimize.  

## Getting Started
Steps- install Express again, install PG, wrote SQL for .GET(), .POST(), and .PUT(). Finally we checked the code by testing all steps to make sure it worked.  

## Architecture
Express, PG, Postgres.
